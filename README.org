** About
   The [[https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/products/usb-gb-c-cart-dumper-the-joey-jr][Joey Jr]] is a great little device that can be used to dump GB/C/A Roms, saves and flash Roms and saves.
   The best supported platform however is windows and the provided script didn't really work for me.
   This here project is used to rewrite / expand the provided script to make using the Joey easier on Linux.

** TODO
   - [ ] Test Write SRAM
   - [ ] Test Write FLASH
   - [ ] Automount Joey
   - [ ] Auto re-mount Joey
   - [ ] Easy way to update ROM list
   - [ ] Improve speed of testing for busy
